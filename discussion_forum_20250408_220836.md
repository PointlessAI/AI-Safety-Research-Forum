Title: Understanding and Mitigating the Societal Impacts of AI Safety Failures

Abstract:
This project investigates how failures in AI safety translate into real-world social, ethical, and economic harms. As AI systems increasingly mediate access to information, justice, healthcare, and employment, even subtle misalignments or vulnerabilities can scale rapidly, affecting millions. This research will map the causal pathways from technical AI failures to societal consequences, and develop strategies for reducing downstream harm through policy, public infrastructure, and model governance.

Background:
AI systems are now entangled with decisions that affect public life, from content moderation to credit scoring. However, their failure modes are often opaque, underreported, or dismissed as technical edge cases. Events such as biased hiring algorithms, unsafe content generation, and the spread of misinformation reveal that technical misalignment often results in systemic inequality, public distrust, and harm to vulnerable communities. There is an urgent need to connect technical research in AI safety with impact assessments rooted in social science.

Objectives:

    Identify and categorize major societal harms resulting from unsafe AI deployments.

    Analyze the mismatch between technical alignment metrics and real-world safety outcomes.

    Propose a multidisciplinary framework for assessing societal risk tied to AI models.

    Recommend public-interest safeguards for mitigating these risks at deployment scale.

Methodology:

    Case Study Analysis: Investigate documented incidents of societal harm caused by unsafe AI outputs.

    Stakeholder Interviews: Gather perspectives from affected users, developers, policymakers, and researchers.

    Risk Mapping: Trace how specific technical failures (e.g., hallucination, bias, jailbreaking) contribute to broader societal issues.

    Policy & Ethics Integration: Partner with ethicists and legal scholars to translate findings into regulatory or governance recommendations.

Expected Outcomes:

    A typology of AI safety failures with mapped societal consequences.

    A cross-disciplinary toolkit for predicting social risk from technical AI design choices.

    Policy briefs and recommendations for standards organizations and regulators.

    Improved protocols for public-facing AI systems, particularly in sensitive domains.

Conclusion:
Technical alignment is not enough if models, once deployed, harm individuals or communities. This project puts societal impact at the center of AI safety research and proposes new models for safeguarding the public from the unintended consequences of intelligent systems.
